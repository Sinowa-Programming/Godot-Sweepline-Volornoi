## FAQ
* Q: **I have a set of points that are not generating correctly. What should I do?**
* A: I suggest you move it slightly to the left or right as inaccurate floating point caclulations may cause errors. If the problem persist, open a github issue with the set of points. The point set will allow me to adapt my code to fit the new edge case.
